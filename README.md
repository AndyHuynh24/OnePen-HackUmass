## 💡 What is it?

Switching tools breaks the flow.  

To make a title, highlight, or draw a box, we stop writing, reach for a toolbar, then return — again and again.  
It’s a small step that, repeated hundreds of times, disrupts thought and creativity.  

Note-taking should feel as natural as paper — only smarter.  
That’s why you need **OnePen**.  

**OnePen** is a handwriting-based note-taking web app that uses **AI stroke recognition** to let you write, format, and organize without ever touching a toolbar.  
You can change style your strokes, or even trigger advanced actions — all directly through how you write.
