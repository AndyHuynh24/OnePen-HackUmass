## 💡 What is it?

Switching tools breaks the flow.  Each time we pause to change a tool — to title, highlight, or box something — our rhythm breaks.  
Those small interruptions, repeated hundreds of times, **disrupt creativity and productivity**. 

Note-taking should feel as natural as paper — only smarter.

That’s why we built **✨ OnePen** — an AI-powered, handwriting-based note-taking web app that understands *how* you write.  

With **AI stroke recognition**, OnePen lets you **write, format, and organize** without ever touching a toolbar.  
Style your strokes, change colors, or trigger advanced actions — **all directly through your handwriting.**
